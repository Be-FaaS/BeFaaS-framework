# Test Application

This part of the project is a collection of deployable functions which together build a first test application.
This demo is mainly used for the purpose of demonstrating FaaS benchmark elements on various (configurable) platforms.

The [experiment.json](./experiment.json) is used to configure the deployment targets while the code itself is
FaaS-platform agnostic
