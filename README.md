# BeFaaS

BeFaaS is an extensible open-source benchmarking framework for FaaS environments which comes with two built-in benchmark suites and respective load profiles: An E-commererce application (web shop) and an IoT application (smart traffic light). BeFaas is the first benchmarking framework which enables the federated benchmark of FaaS providers: Users can split their application and define which function(s) should run on which provider. Currently, BeFaaS supports six FaaS providers on which (parts of) the test suite applications can be deployed and evaluated: 
* AWS Lambda
* Google Cloud Functions
* Azure Functions
* TinyFaaS
* OpenFaaS
* OpenWhisk

## Usage and Futher Information (for developers)
